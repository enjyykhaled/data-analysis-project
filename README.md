# Data Cleaning & Visualization Project

This project focuses on cleaning and visualizing a dataset using Python in Google Colab. It demonstrates the basic steps of preprocessing messy data and creating visual insights through various plots and graphs.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Performed initial exploration and inspection of the dataset.
- Handled missing values and fixed inconsistent data entries.
- Created clear and meaningful visualizations to uncover patterns and insights.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📁 Files

- `your_notebook_name.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all the steps from data cleaning to visualization.

## 🚀 How to Run
